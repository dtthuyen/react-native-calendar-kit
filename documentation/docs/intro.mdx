# Getting Started

## Installation

Install the required packages in your React Native project:

<Tabs
  groupId="environment"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @howljs/calendar-kit
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @howljs/calendar-kit
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The libraries we will install now are [@shopify/flash-list](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/docs/), [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation) and [react-native-gesture-handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation). If you already have these libraries installed and at the latest version, you are done here! Otherwise, read on.

### Installing dependencies into a bare React Native project

In your project directory, run:

<Tabs
  groupId="environment"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'}
  ]}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @shopify/flash-list react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @shopify/flash-list react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Follow installation instructions for [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation) and [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation).
